# TRMNL Plugin Tester

A development tool for testing TRMNL plugins.

## Features

- Shows a list of plugins in this repo
- Allows you to preview each plugin with full, half-horizontal, half-vertical layouts and quadrant layouts
- supports working against local `plugin.json` files or calling your API
- allows copying the layouts and any API url to the clipboard for easy pasting into the [useTRMNL.com](https://usetrmnl.com) plugin dashboard

### Usage

If you want to use this project to test your plugins before you add them to the TRMNL project, then jump to the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.

### Example online
I am deploying the Docker version of this project to [trmnl-plugins.fly.dev](https://trmnl-plugins.fly.dev/) so you can try it out without having to install anything. This version is limited to the plugins in this repo. Any API which needs an API key will not work in the online version so use the Load Preview button to see the plugin in action with sample data.

To develop a plugin, you need to run this locally either by building the Docker image or running the Node.js server.

## Alternative
Whilst I started writing this just to build something for myself, I did not notice the awesome project by @schrockwell - his https://github.com/schrockwell/trmnl_preview/ came before this and so please checkout that too as it gives better results for the preview.

You can also use this project to test your plugins before you add them to the TRMNL project using the script `./scripts/serve-plugin.sh`. 

Execute `./scripts/serve-plugin.sh` to run the plugin with the TRMNL Preview Server by @schrockwell. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- Git installed on your machine

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gitstua/trmnl-plugin-dev.git
cd trmnl-plugin-dev
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
./scripts/run.sh
```

This will start the server and provide the URL to open preview in your browser.

## Docker Support

You can run the TRMNL Plugin Tester using Docker:

### Using Docker Hub Image

To build and run the image, use the following command:
```bash
./scripts/run-docker.sh
```

I have not pushed the image to Docker Hub yet, so you need to build it locally.

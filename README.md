# TRMNL Plugin Tester

A development tool for testing TRMNL plugins.

## Alternative
Whilst I started writing this just to build something for myself, I did not notice the awesome project by @schrockwell - his https://github.com/schrockwell/trmnl_preview/ came before this and so please chekout that too as it may give better results.
